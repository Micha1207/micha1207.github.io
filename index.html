      <h2>Who is Micha1207?</h2>
      <p>Hello! I'm a young geek who's intrested in computers (hardware and software, esspecialy the free software). 
	I make some small projests (you can see some of them on <a href="https://github.com/Micha1207">my GitHub</a>)
	They work on <a href="https://debian.org">Debian GNU/Linux</a>, because I write it on computers with it.</p>
      <hr>
      <h3>Why do I use Debian GNU/Linux?</h3>
      <p>Long story short: I wanted an OS, that will work on most of my hardware: from a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-5/">Raspberry Pi 5B</a> through ThinkPad X250 and other computers to my most powerful one - with 12th generation Intel Core i7 processor. Speaking about my computers, let's see some of them.</p>

      <h3>My computers</h3>
      <p>As said before, I've got a couple of computers. Here's a list:
	<ul>
	  <li>Raspberry Pi 5</li>
	  <li>ThinkPad X250</li>
	  <li>custom built computer with i7-12700K</li>
